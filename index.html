				<p>Uncommon Makes is a day-long experience focused on encouraging University of Chicago students to learn new technologies, make something of their own, and get involved with the tech community on campus. We’ll provide our hackers with the time and support to build a fun project (think Twitter sentiment analysis web application) from scratch, as well as help them expand their technical skills in the process. The day will be packed with workshops and opportunities to engage with exciting technologies in uncommon ways.</p>
				<p>Through activities organized in partnership with tech groups on campus and the guidance of our mentors, you’ll not only learn how to build the Chrome extension you’ve always needed or the iOS app of your dreams, but you’ll actually make it.</p>
